    <li>it is important to get a feel of the problem by making plots</li>
    <li>best eps is computed by looping over few value of eps and computing F1Score. Here we look for the maximal F1Score</li>

    <li>derivative of cost with respect to the features is computed using the chain rule ad gradient descent in a nice lazy programming manner</li>
    <li>using the chain rule evaluate the derivative from right (cost function) to left thus back propagating</li>
    <li>the derivatives are checked via the numeric derivative in debug_check_analytical_derivative()</li>
    <li>taking initial values suggested by StatsQuest and AndrewNg the algorithm is converging but not to the global minima - ssr ~0.7 so result are not good but the learning code is working</li>
    <li>taking initial values around the solution of minimize - check neural_network_learn_minimize is working even when we add eps of 4</li>
    <li>TODO : understand how to get initial values that will cause covergence to the global minima ssr ~ 0</li>
